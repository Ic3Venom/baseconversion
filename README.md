# baseconversion0
Converts base 10 into choice base 2-10... slowly

It works using basic number adding principles, by adding 1 to the one's place until it overflows into the next column, and so on.
- As a result of adding ones and wiping columns into the next one, this process is very slow and recourse intensive, and it is not reccomended to convert large numbers with this program, baseconversion 1 and 2 will be much faster
