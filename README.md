# baseconversion v0.1
By Ic3Venom
Purpose: To convert any base 10 number in range of 1 to 18446744073709551615
    into bases 2-16, using numeric values 0-F.
Note: I did not see any other programs of conversion and I challenged myself to
    convert numbers without using things like '0b', '0x', or 'o'. The only
    resources used were the MSDN library from Microsoft to help with int sizes
    and their pointers.
