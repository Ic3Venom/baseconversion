# baseconversion "completed" v1.0
By Ic3Venom
- Purpose: To convert base 2-16 into base 2-16, using numeric values 0-F.
- Note: I did not see any other programs of conversion and I challenged myself to
    convert numbers without using memory addresses and pointers. The only
    resources used were the MSDN library from Microsoft to help with int sizes
    and pointers.
- 26 August 2016: merged the other 2 repositories of the different versions of baseconversion and made them branches in this one.
- 5 January 2017: came back to this program to remaster the entire program... again. Possibly new algorithms created by myself.
