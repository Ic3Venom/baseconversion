# baseconversion completed v1.0
By Ic3Venom
- Purpose: To convert base 2-16 into base 2-16, using numeric values 0-F.
- Note: I did not see any other programs of conversion and I challenged myself to
    convert numbers without using things like '0b', '0x', or 'o'. The only
    resources used were the MSDN library from Microsoft to help with inter sizes
    and pointers.
- 26 August 2016: merged the other 2 repositories of the different versions of baseconversion and made them branches in this one.
